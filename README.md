## Features:

1. **Menu:**

    - Can admin create categories, subcategories, and items for his menu?
        - Yes.
    - What is the maximum level of subcategories?
        - Currently capped at Four.
    - Can category or subcategory have mixed children?

    - Is the menu be returned from the backend with computed discounts?
        - Yes!
