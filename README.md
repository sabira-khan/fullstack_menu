Let‚Äôs build a restaurant menu that contains categories, subcategories, and items with supporting discounts. üçΩÔ∏è

## Features:

1. **Menu:**

    - Can admin create categories, subcategories, and items for his menu?
        - Yes.
    - What is the maximum level of subcategories?
        - Currently capped at Four.
    - Can category or subcategory have mixed children?

## Instructions of use:

-   Create a category first (ie. breakfast, dinner etc).
-   Create sucategories underneath (in each case, choose parent category, max level of subcategories under a category is 4).
-   Create items under leaf categories (items can only be created if parent category doesn't have any direct Category child at same level).
-   Create discounts to return discounted pricing for menu frontend
-   Full menu discount is applied to all items.
-   Category/Subcategory level discount is inherited by items if there's no existing discount.
-   Discount can be directly applied to a single item too.
